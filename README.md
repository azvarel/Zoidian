Theme Zoidian for Recalbox 4.x

I always enjoyed simple themes, without much color and the zoid theme always caught my attention, so I had a lot of zoid headaches, it did not work on my 40" TV, I decided to do a re-reading of it, adapting to its functioning for the Recalbox 4.0 and Zoidian renamed it

The theme was based on simplelight and what I did was eliminate the synopsis and increased the field of boxart / screenshot repositioning some elements. I intend to one day do more themes, but for now the one for me already answers my requests.

For those who do not want to see the capcom logo on fba_libretro, just change the bg2.jpg and logo2.svg by bg.jpg and logo.svg more information in the readme.txt file inside the folder fba_libretro.
